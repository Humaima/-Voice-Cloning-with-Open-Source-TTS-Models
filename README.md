# -Voice-Cloning-with-Open-Source-TTS-Models
This project explores voice cloning capabilities using state-of-the-art open-source Text-to-Speech (TTS) models: **Kokoro-82M**, **CSM-1B**, and **XTTS-v2**. The goal was to build an end-to-end pipeline for voice cloning, from dataset creation to optimized inference deployment.
